How do you find the expected value of a binomial distribution?

->Definition
The binomial distribution is non-normal distribution and is a probability distribution that describes the number of successes 
in a fixed number of independent trials(n), where each trial has the same probability of success(p).

Formula
The expected value of a binomial distribution is equal to the number of trials multiplied by the probability of success, 
which is denoted as:

E(X)=nâˆ—p
For example, if you were flipping a coin five times, 

n would be 5 and 

p would be 0.5 (assuming the coin is fair) and the expected value is 2.5, 
you could expect to get 2.5 heads on average.
