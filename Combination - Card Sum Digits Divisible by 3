Q. 10 cards numbered from 1 to 10. Pick 3 cards. Probability that the sum of digits of the chosen cards 
is divisible by 3. 

A.
3n - 2 (remainder): {1, 4, 7, 10}
3n - 1 (remainder): {2, 5, 8}
3n (remainder): {3, 6, 9}


1) ALL three numbers are divisible by 3
=> 3C3 =1

2) ALL three numbers have remainder 1 when divided by 3
=> 4C3 =4

3) ALL three numbers have remainder 2 when divided by 3
=> 3C3 =1

4) One number is divisible by 3, one number has remainder 1 when divided by 3
,and one number has remainder 2 when divided by 3
=> 3C1 * 4C1 * 3C1 =36

The number of favorable cases is 1+4+1+36=42


Since there are 10C3=120 possible ways to select three numbers from the set [10]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
The probability that the sum of the numbers on the cards that are drawn is divisible by 3
42/120 = 720
