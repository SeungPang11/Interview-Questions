When do you use mean vs median?

->
Mean represents the average value of the dataset. 
Median represents the middle value of a dataset. 
It is calculated by arranging all observations in a dataset from 
smallest to largest and then identifying the middle value.

Usage
Mean is used as a metric to describe the center of a dataset when the distribution 
is mostly symmetrical with no outliers. 
A symmetrical distribution is a distribution that, 
if split down the middle, each half will look roughly equal.

Median is used as a metric to describe the center of a dataset when the distribution 
is skewed to the left or right, or there are outliers present.
