What methods would you use to detect outliers in a dataset?

->
Statistical Methods-
Z-Score: Calculate the Z-score for each data point based on its deviation from the mean. 
Values beyond a certain threshold (e.g., Z-score > 3 or < -3) can be considered outliers.

Visualization-
Box plots: Visualize the distribution of data using quartiles. Points outside the whiskers can be identified as potential outliers.
Scatter plots: Plot the data points and visually inspect for any observations that deviate significantly from the overall pattern.
Histograms: Examine the distribution of data and identify any extreme values that lie far outside the main cluster.

Machine Learning-Based Methods-
Clustering techniques: Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN) and identify data points that do not belong to any cluster or form separate clusters.
Isolation Forest: Use an ensemble of decision trees to isolate outliers by identifying data points that require fewer splits to be isolated.
