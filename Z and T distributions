What is the difference between the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) and the Student's t-distribution?

-> 
The standard normal distribution is used to estimate the mean of a population 
when the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large. 

On the other hand, the Student's t-distribution is used to estimate the 
the mean of a given population when the sample standard deviation is known, 
and the sample size is small - less than 30.
